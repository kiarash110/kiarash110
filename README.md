# 👋 Hi, I'm Kiarash!

I am a student developer with a deep interest in **Cybersecurity** and **Python programming**. I believe in learning by doing, which is why I build tools that focus on data privacy and protection.

### 🛡️ What I'm working on
* **[Aegis-1T](https://github.com/kiarash110/Aegis-1T):** My main project—a file vault designed to handle large-scale data (up to 1TB) using professional-grade encryption like **AES-256-GCM**.
* **MFA Systems:** Learning how to implement 2FA/TOTP to keep user accounts safe.

### 🌱 What I'm currently learning
* **Advanced Python:** Moving from basic scripts to high-performance, memory-efficient code.
* **Cryptography:** Understanding the "Why" behind encryption algorithms like Argon2id.
* **Open Source:** Learning how to document my work so it can help others.

### 🛠️ My Toolbox
* **Language:** Python
* **Security:** MFA, Cryptography Libraries (PyCryptodome), Data Integrity
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code
