# 👋 Hi, I'm Kiarash!

I am a student developer focused on **Cybersecurity** and **Secure Software Development**. I build tools that explore the intersection of data privacy, encryption, and web security.

### 🛡️ Featured Project
* **[Aegis-1T](https://github.com/kiarash110/Aegis-1T):** A high-performance file vault for large-scale data (1TB+) using **AES-256-GCM** encryption and **Argon2id** key derivation.

### 🌱 My Learning Roadmap
* **Cybersecurity:** Studying network security, penetration testing basics, and cryptographic integrity.
* **Web Security (HTML/CSS/JS):** Learning the "Big Three" to understand web vulnerabilities like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
* **Python:** Mastered basic automation; now focusing on memory-efficient security tools.

### 🛠️ My Toolbox
* **Languages:** Python, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Learning)
* **Security:** MFA/TOTP, Cryptography (PyCryptodome), Secure File Shredding
* **Development:** Git, GitHub, Linux Command Line
